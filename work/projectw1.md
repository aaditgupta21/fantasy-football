# Project Week 1

## Identify and Apply a Software Development process.

### Describe your Software Development Life Cycle
(The software development life cycle is a process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying information systems across hardware and software)

```

```

### Describe how you plan, track sprints, track features, track milestones, and assign versions.

```

```

### Highlight Agile process: research, design, coding, testing, review, repeat.
(What is Agile: The agile methodology focuses strongly on user input and experience, which can solve many issues that arose from older applications that were more cumbersome to use. The software, as it moves through the agile process, is very responsive to feedback and works to release software in quicker cycles in order to adhere to a changing and rapid market.)

```

```


## Define and analyze systems and software requirements.

### Define Computer Systems you will develop.

```

```

### Indicate Tools or Automation you will use improve tracking requirements.

```

```

### Define strategies that enable Team to target the specific needs of the customer (ie Product Owner)meetings, demos, and collecting feedback.

```

```


## Create and implement and effective frontend between humans and technology

### Show frontend design artifacts (wire frames)

```

```

### Describe any consideration you have made for customer needs.

```

```

### Indicate accommodations you have made for English Language Learners or those with Disabilities

```

```


## Develop software using programming languages

### Identify authoring tools (IDE’s, Docker) used

```

```

### Describe and/or show visuals which interactions and integration of programming languages, protocols, and data within project (Flow Chart/UML).

```

```

### Describe and/or illustrate key Procedures, Functions, Algorithms that will be required to complete this system (Flow Chart/UML).
(Be sure to use comments in code to facilitate current and future understanding of the key portions of system.)
```

```


## Develop data, data types, databases, and APIs.

### Identify authoring tools (IDE’s, Postman) used.

```

```

### Describe and/or illustrate key data types, data structures, objects, files, and databases that will be used (Flow Chart/UML).

```

```

### Describe use of database, tables, attributes, records, and systems of access (POJOs, JPAs)
(Be sure to use comments in code to facilitate current and future understanding of the key portions of data.)
```

```


## Test and Demo Software during each Sprint

### Consider using GitHub Issues to support this process.

```

```

### Develop and describe expectations of each feature.

```

```

### Use feature, expected outcome, and the minimal amount of code each feature.

```

```

### Document accomplishment with tangible evidence.

```

```

### Have feature reviews, demos, and obtain feedback (team and/or customer)

```

```

### Update and derive new features and tasks for next step in Software Development Life Cycle

```

```
